# qping
qping: qping is simple python tool for finding bunch of live subdomains.Generally subdomain enumeration tools (Eg. sublist3r) provide a list that consists of both Live and down subdomains. Hence the user time will be wasted to separate the live sub domains alone. So we have introduced this simple qping tool to get the live subdomains. qping read the subdomain list which is provided by subdomain enumeration tool and gives the online subdomain list separately for bug bounty.
